/**
 * @mainpage The Project: "In Search of the Cursed Islandâ€™s Treasure"
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 * This project involves developing a simple game in C, leveraging modular programming, 
 * state machines, and Makefiles. The player controls an adventurer navigating a 10x10 
 * grid to find a hidden treasure while avoiding traps and pirates.
 *
 * @section features Key Features
 * - **Gameplay:** The game runs in the terminal, using `z`, `q`, `s`, and `d` keys for movement.
 * - **Initial Mechanics (Increment 1):** The player starts at a fixed position, and the treasure 
 *   is placed randomly. The game is won when the player reaches the treasure.
 *
 * @section increments Further Increments
 * - **Increment 2:** The player has health points and loses them upon stepping on traps.
 * - **Increment 3:** A pirate is introduced, chasing the player if visible and moving randomly otherwise.
 *
 * @section objectives Educational Objectives
 * - Writing a structured Makefile.
 * - Implementing a modular C program.
 * - Designing and coding a state machine to manage game logic.
 *
 * This project serves as an advanced C programming exercise, reinforcing key software development concepts.
