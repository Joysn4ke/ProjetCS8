This project involves developing a simple game in C, leveraging modular programming, state machines, and Makefiles. The player controls an adventurer navigating a 10x10 grid to find a hidden treasure while avoiding traps and pirates.\hypertarget{index_features}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Key Features}{Key Features}}\label{index_features}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Gameplay\+:}} The game runs in the terminal, using {\ttfamily z}, {\ttfamily q}, {\ttfamily s}, and {\ttfamily d} keys for movement.
\item {\bfseries{Initial Mechanics (Increment 1)\+:}} The player starts at a fixed position, and the treasure is placed randomly. The game is won when the player reaches the treasure.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_increments}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Further Increments}{Further Increments}}\label{index_increments}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Increment 2\+:}} The player has health points and loses them upon stepping on traps.
\item {\bfseries{Increment 3\+:}} A pirate is introduced, chasing the player if visible and moving randomly otherwise.
